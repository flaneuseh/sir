SIR Model of Disease Transmission
An implementation in Processing by Kaylah Facey.

Controls:
* space bar - Toggle continuous simulation mode.
* s - Take a single simulation step and stop.
* digits 1 through 6 - re-initialize the cells based on one of six scenarios:
	1. No agent movement; infection spreads to most of population. (>80%)
	2. No agent movement; infection quickly dies down, leaving most of the population unaffected. (<20%)
	3. No agent movement; infection spreads to about half of the population. (40%-60%)
	4. Continuous agent movement; infection spreads to most of population. (>80%)
	5. Continuous agent movement; infection quickly dies down, leaving most of the population unaffected. (<20%)
	6. Continuous agent movement; infection spreads to about half of the population. (40%-60%)
